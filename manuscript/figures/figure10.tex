    \caption{Successive permutations from none ($i=0$) to eight ($i=8$) of the graph adjacency matrix of interactions among pocket gophers and their chewing lice parasites from Hafner {\em et al.} \cite{hafner1994disparate}. Permutations are carried out by swapping the associations of randomly chosen links in between the host and parasite tree. }
